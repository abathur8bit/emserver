# Stuff

This server builds, but not all classes are being used. I am building a different server that uses
more updated classes, and just rolling back the lua support.

World
 MudObject
 Room
 Player
  ClientHandler
  EMScript
 ScriptCmd
 Area


 emscript.cpp, adding the countRoomItems script command.

 Working on being able to count if there are visible items in the room
 so we can skip the "Also in the room" text if there are no players
 or items.

 See emscript.cpp, roomdefaults.b:showRoomItems

 -working putting list into area list in world.cpp

 # extra workds and objects

 In the case of talking to the vampire:

 talk is defined in `commands.ini` as `talk onTalk object`
 vampire is defined in `extrawords.ini` as `vampire vampire.b object`.


 1. Breaks input into verb and command.
 2. Looks up the command (was defined in extrawords.ini).
 3. Checks the command type (object player room).
 4. Checks if the player is carrying the object (not in this case).
 5. Checks if the room contains the object (not in this case).
 6. Checks if the word exists via world lookup word.
 7. Runs the handler for the object, as defined in extrawords.ini.

 # Extra commands
 Added in EMScript, and SmallBasic functions.

 ## setobject
 Sets the current object **ov** to the object specifed.

 setobject itemId,location,found

 - itemid - The object id of the item you are looking for
 - location - 1 = players inventory, 2 = the room the player is in.

 # Unit testing
